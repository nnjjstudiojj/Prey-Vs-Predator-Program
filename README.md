# Prey-Vs-Predator-Program
This is a cool little project I've been working on for 2 weeks as part of my 1 program a week hobby for 2026. More information in the README

Recently I learnt the Java programming language, but realised my programming skills were sub-par and I couldn't make the sorts of programs I wanted to make. I wanted to use 2026 to track my progress and see how much my skills have developed so I could look back fondly and think that I have used my time well. 

I worked on this project for about 2 weeks, where I realised I was being quite lazy and a program of this magnitude for someone of my skill level should have taken me around 1 week, but I guess these are the sorts of imperfections that make us human. I also held back from posting this program immediately, as I felt that this was quite a week show of skill and not very hard to program. I even felt my foundation was quite weak, as I started learning about new data types like hashmaps during the creation of the project, where I prompty switched to using them for some parts, where initially I was using arrayLists for my prey and predator objects. Also my implementation of practices I had been learning were also quite weak. I had started reading books on programming, especially in java and I had cliqued with a book called "Clean Code A Handbook of Agile Software by Cecil Martin" and read a bit into it whilsted creating the project and reading a few chapters. I felt that I hadn't implemented his teachings to the best of my abillity and that is really tragic honestly.

I feel that you can tell alot about someone by the way they carry themselves in public and in the programming space, by the quality of a programmer's code. I know that I could've done better, but in hopes to release the program quickly I compromised quality, and I feel that I respect myself a little less now...

However, I hope this is going to be the start of a up and coming programmer. This program really tested my beginner problem solving skills and tested my use of basic implementation of the Java language. I hope that in future I can create bigger and better projects with greater code quality! For my next program I am planning to implement the use of JavaFX, for my GUI instead of the old Swing GUI. I used Swing for this program, because I heard it was better for beginner programmers, however I think my skills have matured a bit and I am ready to take on a new challenge. The new program will have somthing to do for geographical locations around the world, so I plan to implement the uses of other APIs. This project scope will likely be the biggest project I've worked on since and it will test my dedication to programming. 

Thank you for listening and I hope you follow me along on my journey.

EXTRA INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAM

My main motivation for releasing this program was a computer science project a friend had been working on for his coursework in Python. My friend used AI for the development of his program, which inspired me to make a similar program without the use of AI. I banned the use of AI because I felt that it would be a good challenge for me and not because I hate the use of AI for programming. My stance on AI is that it is good until it isn't like with making researching much easier, despite being terrible for personal problem solving and creativity, like with AI generated art being fed off of real artists, ect. The use of AI in programming is mostly fine for by me, however the programmer using AI should be subject to more scrutiny because AI can produce certain flaws, such as securtiy issues and so the programmer should have a good understanding of programming, the languaged used and what certain lines of code do. 

I chose to program this in Java because I had completely forgot how to program in Python and so I was ready for a fresh start. I learnt Java in a week for a project I was planning to work on, however I found that my programming skills in generaly were extremely disappointing, so I re-focused to learning programming, producing a few projects here and there, before starting the little challenge I set for myself for 2026.

EXTRA INFORMATION ABOUT ME

As of publishing this program on github I have recently turned 17 and am in my first year of College/ Sixthform. I currently am performing average in my classes of: Mathematics, Physics and Further Mathematics. Given that I am not revising and haven't revised for any of my tests. This arrogance is a huge flaw of mine as I should be aiming much higher and for bigger and better. However, I keep finding myself disappointed through and through with boredom in the subjects I have chosen. I have thought about it and asked friends, but I don't think I can put this into words. I have always felt that not revising is an excuse to be lazy rather than a compliment and if you under-perform whilst revising it's less shamefull than performing without revision. 

Recently I picked up revising, aiming for 2 hours a day, in order to prepare myself for the upcoming mocks post Easter, which are important for the predicted grades for University applications I will be making. I hope to update anyone interested in a future program README, however we will see how consistent I am with my programming challenge for this year.

CURRENT HOBBIES

I like to: draw, write, read, program and work-out through cardio and callisthenics.

Currently, I am working on developing my drawing skills and trying to become more proficient at writing. I am also working on improving my programming skills to the stage at, which I can profit off of it (a good indication I can work on somthing I love for the rest of my life) and I have learnt linux commands, which I plan on improving by using different distros of linux and ricing (mostly for fun); I also plan to learn other programming skills like Git.

I am also working with different hardware and understanding how it all works, with different boards such as Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I also plan to move down to a lower-level language and quickly learn JavaScript, HTML and CSS along the way. I also hope to achieve certain fitness goals throughout the process.

Thank you for reading so far, and I hope that you will pick up small projects like this one.
